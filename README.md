# Datasets of structural forms

This repository contains a collection of manually-generated topology and form diagrams generated by the CEM framework. 

The motivation is to use the data here contained to a build tools that benefit from graph machine learning (ML) to improve form generation processes in structural and architectural design.

We look forward to hearing how you use these topologies and forms in your next graph ML research adventure!

## Available datasets

- [x] üåâ Bridge topologies (Under construction)
- [ ] üçï Randomized unit circle (Coming soon)

## How to add data to the bridge topologies dataset

**‚ö†Ô∏èWarning‚ö†Ô∏è: Do not use auxiliary trails when building a topology diagram unless it is absolutely necessary!** 

0. Be acquainted with how the CEM framework works. Read papers
1. Install compas_cem
2. Take a bridge example from the book catalog
	3. Model it in plain text with python or using rhino the grasshopper plugin
	4. Make a proof of concept in 2D and a proof of concept in 3d.
	5. Export the diagrams as a json file and also a pdf snapshot of how the diagram looks.

We are interested in creating parametric families of each of the  topology diagrams of each of the bridge examples in the book catalog. Per diagram (form or typology): JSON file, and snapshot image of diagram.

Go into the drive folder: Rhino file, grasshopper script

Topology diagram
	JSON files
	2d and 3d
		proof-of-concept (most basic) - requires image
		with deck variations (what is the range?) - requires images
	only 3d
		with bracing - requires images

Form diagram
	2d and 3d
		- JSON file only for the proof of concept (after constrained form-finding)
		- Snapshot only for proof-of-concept.


### Naming convention

To identify our data, we set a consistent naming schema. The idea is that the name of any two diagrams is unique. Therefore, any file must be stored using the following filename:

```
familyname_diagram_2dor3d_numnodes_numsupports_numloads_numedges_numtrailedges_numdeviationedges_numauxtrails_variant
```
		
Here is a fictitious example:

```
warrentruss_topology_3d_10_2_5_20_15_5_1_1.json
```

Let's break the name down: this is the `JSON` file of the topology diagram of a 3D structure that belong to the `warrentruss` bridge family. The diagram contains 10 nodes of which 2 are supports and 5 have a load applied onto. Similarly, of a total of 20 edges, 15 are trail edges and 5 are a deviation edges. This topology diagram contains 1 auxiliary trail and is the first variant of how to model the structure topologically.

The snapshot image of this topology diagram would have the exact same name, but the filename extension would be `.pdf` instead of `json`

#### Schema description

- `familyname`: The (arbitrary) name we give to a unique bridge type.
- `diagram`: What diagram are we looking at? Could be either `topology` or `form`.
- `numnodes`: How many nodes are in the diagram?
- `numsupportnodes`: How many nodes have supports assigned to them?
- `numloads`: How many nodes have a load applied onto them?
- `numedges`: The number of edges in the diagram.
- `numtrailedges`: The number of trail edges in the diagram.
- `numdeviationedges`: The number of deviation edges in the diagram.
- `numauxiliary`: The number of auxiliary trails in the diagram.
- `variant`: Recall that a structure can be topologically modeled in more than one way within the CEM framework. Consequently, if there are multiple versions of the topological diagram of a structure (and their corresponding form diagram), by changing `variant` field is how we further distinguish among them (e.g. variant `1`, `2`, `3`, and so on).
